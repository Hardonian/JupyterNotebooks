**Last Updated:** 2024-01-XX

This document outlines monetization models, pricing strategies, and implementation approaches for Agent Factory.

## 🎯 Monetization Philosophy

**Open Core Model:** The core platform is open source (GPL-3.0). Premium features, hosted services, and enterprise offerings generate revenue.

**Value-Based Pricing:** Price based on value delivered, not cost to serve.

**Multiple Revenue Streams:** Diversify revenue through subscriptions, marketplace, and services.

## 🏗️ Implementation

### Billing Integration

Agent Factory includes billing hooks:

```python
from agent_factory.billing import track_usage, check_limits
from agent_factory.payments import StripeClient

# Track usage
track_usage(
    tenant_id=tenant.id,
    event_type="agent_run",
    quantity=1
)

# Check limits
if not check_limits(tenant.id, "agent_runs"):
    raise LimitExceededError()

# Process payment
stripe = StripeClient()
stripe.charge_usage(tenant.id, usage)
```

### Usage Tracking

Automatic usage tracking:

```python
# Usage is tracked automatically
# But you can also track custom events:
track_usage(
    tenant_id=tenant.id,
    event_type="custom_feature",
    quantity=1,
    metadata={"feature": "advanced_analytics"}
)
```

### Marketplace Revenue Sharing

```python
from agent_factory.marketplace import purchase_blueprint, calculate_revenue_share

# Purchase blueprint
purchase = purchase_blueprint(
    blueprint_id="support_bot",
    tenant_id=tenant.id,
    price=99.00
)

# Calculate revenue share
revenue_share = calculate_revenue_share(
    purchase_id=purchase.id,
    creator_percentage=0.70
)

# Distribute revenue
distribute_to_creator(revenue_share.creator_amount)
```
