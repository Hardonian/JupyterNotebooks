## Section A: CORE PITCH

### 1-Sentence Answer to "What are you working on?"

**Answer:**
"Agent Factory gives developers everything they need to build, deploy, and monetize AI agents—from prototype to production—without the usual infrastructure headaches."

**Practice:** Say this 10 times until it's natural.

---

### 3-5 Bullets: "What's New and Why It's Important"

**Answer:**
1. **Complete Platform:** Not just a library (like LangChain), but a full platform with infrastructure, billing, compliance
2. **Notebook-to-Production:** Unique workflow that converts Jupyter notebooks to deployable agents in minutes
3. **Education-First:** FERPA compliance and LMS integration make us the only platform ready for education
4. **Marketplace Flywheel:** Blueprint marketplace creates network effects (more blueprints → more users → more blueprints)
5. **Production-Ready:** Built-in billing, multi-tenancy, compliance—ship SaaS products in days, not months

**Practice:** Explain each bullet in 30 seconds.

## Section G: RISKS & HARD QUESTIONS

### 5 Scariest Likely Interview Questions

#### Question 1: "Why won't LangChain just add these features?"

**Answer:**
- LangChain is a library, we're a platform. Different business model.
- We have infrastructure (billing, multi-tenancy, compliance) they don't have.
- Marketplace creates network effects they can't replicate.
- Education focus (FERPA, LMS) is our moat.
- Switching costs: users build on our platform, hard to leave.

**Evidence:**
- Complete platform vs. library (see `/yc/YC_TECH_OVERVIEW.md`)
- Marketplace infrastructure exists
- Education compliance built-in

---

#### Question 2: "What if OpenAI/Anthropic changes pricing?"

**Answer:**
- We support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, can add more).
- Abstract LLM interface makes it easy to add providers.
- Usage-based pricing passes costs to customers.
- Cost optimization (caching, batching) reduces impact.
- Can consider self-hosting models for enterprise.

**Evidence:**
- Multiple provider support (`agent_factory/integrations/`)
- Cost tracking (`agent_factory/financial/cost_tracker.py`)
- Usage-based pricing (billing plans)

---

#### Question 3: "How do you compete with free (LangChain, AutoGPT)?"

**Answer:**
- Free tools are libraries/prototypes, we're production platform.
- They require infrastructure work, we provide it.
- Time-to-market: days vs. months.
- Cost: $99/month vs. $200K custom development.
- Education compliance (FERPA) they don't have.

**Evidence:**
- Complete platform vs. library
- Production infrastructure built-in
- Education compliance (see `/yc/YC_MARKET_VISION.md`)

---

#### Question 4: "What's your moat? Why won't someone copy you?"

**Answer:**
1. **Switching Costs:** Users build on platform, integrations create lock-in.
2. **Education Compliance:** FERPA compliance and LMS integration are hard to build.
3. **Network Effects:** Marketplace creates flywheel (more blueprints → more users).
4. **First-Mover Advantage:** We're first to market with complete platform.
5. **Execution:** We've built comprehensive platform, hard to replicate quickly.

**Evidence:**
- Multi-tenancy and integrations (see `/yc/YC_DEFENSIBILITY_NOTES.md`)
- Marketplace infrastructure
- Education compliance framework

---

#### Question 5: "What if you don't get traction?"

**Answer:**
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Add real traction data
- We have [X] users, [Y] revenue, [Z] growth rate.
- Education partnership (McGraw Hill) provides distribution.
- Open-source adoption drives developer acquisition.
- Marketplace creates network effects.
- Multiple revenue streams (SaaS, marketplace, services).

**Plan B:**
- Focus on education market (high switching costs, recurring revenue).
- Pivot to enterprise (higher contract values).
- Consider white-label/on-premise for large customers.

**⚠️ Need Real Data:**
- Actual traction metrics
- Plan B specifics
