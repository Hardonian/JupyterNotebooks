## Founder-Market Fit Narrative

**The Story:**

"We've all been there. You build an AI agent prototype in a Jupyter notebook. It works beautifully. People love it. Then you try to deploy it, and reality hits: you need auth, billing, multi-tenancy, error handling, observability, compliance... Suddenly your simple idea needs a team of engineers and months of work.

**We built Agent Factory because we've lived this problem.**

Scott Hardie spent 15+ years at McGraw Hill and Pearson Education, helping institutions deploy AI-powered learning platforms. He saw the gap firsthand: institutions wanted AI tools, but couldn't deploy them due to infrastructure complexity, compliance requirements, and LMS integration challenges.

He also built multiple AI-driven systems himself—Hardonia OS (AI-driven Shopify commerce lab), PromptPilot (SaaS framework for prompt refinement), and Daily Intel Suite (9 agents delivering insights). Each time, he hit the same wall: the AI worked, but deploying it required months of infrastructure work.

The notebook converter feature came directly from this experience—the frustration of having a working prototype stuck in a Jupyter notebook, unable to reach production without building everything from scratch.

**We're not building this for abstract users—we're building it for ourselves.**

We understand the pain because we've felt it. We understand the solution because we've built it. We understand the education market because we've worked in it for 15+ years. We understand the infrastructure challenges because we've solved them.

**That's why Agent Factory exists: to solve the problem we've all faced, built by people who've lived it."**
