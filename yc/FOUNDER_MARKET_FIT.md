## Founder-Market Fit Narrative

**The Story:**

"We've all been there. You build an AI agent prototype in a Jupyter notebook. It works beautifully. People love it. Then you try to deploy it, and reality hits: you need auth, billing, multi-tenancy, error handling, observability, compliance... Suddenly your simple idea needs a team of engineers and months of work.

**We built Agent Factory because we've lived this problem.**

[Founder 1] built production infrastructure at [Previous Company]. Saw hundreds of AI agent prototypes die because developers couldn't build the infrastructure. [Founder 2] worked in EdTech and saw institutions struggling to deploy AI tools due to compliance and integration challenges. [Founder 3] built AI agents in research and hit the wall trying to deploy.

**We're not building this for abstract users—we're building it for ourselves.**

We understand the pain because we've felt it. We understand the solution because we've built it. We understand the market because we're in it.

**That's why Agent Factory exists: to solve the problem we've all faced, built by people who've lived it."**
