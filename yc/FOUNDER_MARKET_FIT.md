## Founder-Market Fit Narrative

**The Story:**

"We've all been there. You build an AI agent prototype in a Jupyter notebook. It works beautifully. People love it. Then you try to deploy it, and reality hits: you need auth, billing, multi-tenancy, error handling, observability, compliance... Suddenly your simple idea needs a team of engineers and months of work.

**We built Agent Factory because we've lived this problem.**

Scott Hardie built production infrastructure and saw the gap between prototypes and production firsthand. He witnessed AI agent prototypes fail not because the AI didn't work, but because developers couldn't build the infrastructure needed to deploy them. The notebook converter feature came directly from this experience—the frustration of having a working prototype stuck in a Jupyter notebook.

**We're not building this for abstract users—we're building it for ourselves.**

We understand the pain because we've felt it. We understand the solution because we've built it. We understand the market because we're in it.

**That's why Agent Factory exists: to solve the problem we've all faced, built by people who've lived it."**
