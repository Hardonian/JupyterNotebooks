**Gaps Remaining:** 14

**By Severity:**
- HIGH: 7 gaps
- MEDIUM: 7 gaps

**By Effort:**
- LOW: 3 gaps
- MEDIUM: 10 gaps
- HIGH: 1 gap

## Key Metrics to Track

**As we close gaps, track:**
- Number of gaps closed
- Real user metrics (DAU, WAU, MAU)
- Real revenue metrics (MRR, ARR)
- Real unit economics (CAC, LTV)
- Customer testimonials collected
- Distribution experiments executed

---

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Strong technical foundation
- Comprehensive platform architecture
- Clear monetization strategy
- Education focus with partnership

**Weaknesses:**
- No real user data
- Unknown team/founders
- No customer validation
