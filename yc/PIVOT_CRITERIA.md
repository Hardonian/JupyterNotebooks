# Pivot Criteria - Agent Factory

**For:** Lean Startup, Strategic Decision Making, Risk Management  
**Last Updated:** 2024-01-XX

---

## Overview

This document defines criteria for when to pivot. Pivoting is changing strategy when evidence suggests the current approach isn't working. Clear criteria help make pivot decisions objectively.

---

## Pivot Philosophy

### When to Pivot
- **Evidence suggests current approach won't work**
- **Better opportunity identified**
- **Market conditions changed**
- **Key assumptions invalidated**

### When NOT to Pivot
- **Early stage uncertainty** (normal, not a reason to pivot)
- **Temporary setbacks** (pivot only if persistent)
- **Competition** (pivot only if fundamental disadvantage)

---

## Pivot Triggers

### Problem Hypothesis Invalidated

**Trigger:** Problem doesn't exist or isn't acute enough

**Criteria:**
- <1% signup rate after 1000 visitors (problem awareness low)
- <30% of interviewed users confirm the problem
- <50% have experienced the problem

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Pivot Problem:** Target different problem
2. **Pivot Customer:** Target customers with different problem
3. **Pivot Market:** Enter different market

**Example:** If developers don't struggle with infrastructure, pivot to different problem (e.g., AI agent quality, not infrastructure).

---

### Customer Hypothesis Invalidated

**Trigger:** Target customers don't want or can't use the product

**Criteria:**
- <10% conversion rate from free to paid (customers won't pay)
- <40% activation rate (customers can't use product)
- <50% satisfaction rating (customers don't like product)

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Pivot Customer:** Target different customer segment
2. **Pivot Solution:** Build different solution for same customers
3. **Pivot Problem:** Solve different problem for same customers

**Example:** If solo founders don't convert, pivot to product teams or enterprises.

---

### Solution Hypothesis Invalidated

**Trigger:** Solution doesn't solve the problem effectively

**Criteria:**
- <50% satisfaction rating (solution doesn't work)
- <30% of users achieve desired outcome (solution ineffective)
- Average time to production >7 days (solution doesn't save time)

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Pivot Solution:** Build different solution
2. **Pivot Features:** Change feature set
3. **Pivot Approach:** Change product approach (e.g., platform → tool)

**Example:** If Agent Factory doesn't reduce time to production, pivot to different solution approach.

---

### Revenue Hypothesis Invalidated

**Trigger:** Customers won't pay or pricing is wrong

**Criteria:**
- <5% conversion rate from free to paid (customers won't pay)
- <30% willing to pay target price (pricing too high)
- <$10K MRR after 6 months (revenue too low)

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Pivot Pricing:** Change pricing model or tiers
2. **Pivot Revenue Model:** Change revenue streams (e.g., marketplace → enterprise)
3. **Pivot Customer:** Target customers willing to pay

**Example:** If developers won't pay $49-199/month, pivot to enterprise-only or usage-based pricing.

---

### Growth Hypothesis Invalidated

**Trigger:** Growth channels don't work or growth is too slow

**Criteria:**
- <1.0 viral coefficient after marketplace launch (no flywheel)
- <100 signups/month after 3 months (growth too slow)
- CAC > LTV (unit economics don't work)

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Pivot Channels:** Try different growth channels
2. **Pivot Product:** Change product to enable growth
3. **Pivot Market:** Enter market with better growth potential

**Example:** If marketplace flywheel doesn't work, pivot to different growth channels (e.g., sales, partnerships).

---

### Market Hypothesis Invalidated

**Trigger:** Market isn't large enough or accessible

**Criteria:**
- <$100K ARR after 12 months (market too small)
- <10 customers after 12 months (market inaccessible)
- Competition too strong (can't compete)

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Pivot Market:** Enter different market
2. **Pivot Segment:** Target different segment
3. **Pivot Geography:** Enter different geography

**Example:** If education market doesn't work, pivot to broader developer market or enterprise market.

## Pivot Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess Evidence
- **Review Metrics:** What do the metrics say?
- **Review Learnings:** What have we learned?
- **Review Experiments:** What do experiments show?

### Step 2: Evaluate Pivot Triggers
- **Check Criteria:** Do any pivot triggers apply?
- **Assess Severity:** How severe is the problem?
- **Consider Timing:** Is it too early to pivot?

### Step 3: Explore Pivot Options
- **Brainstorm Options:** What are the pivot options?
- **Evaluate Options:** Which option is best?
- **Assess Risk:** What's the risk of pivoting?

### Step 4: Make Decision
- **Decision:** Pivot or persist?
- **Rationale:** Why this decision?
- **Plan:** What's the pivot plan?

### Step 5: Execute & Monitor
- **Execute Pivot:** Implement pivot
- **Monitor Results:** Track pivot results
- **Iterate:** Adjust based on results

## Pivot Examples

### Example 1: Problem Pivot

**Original:** Developers struggle with infrastructure
**Evidence:** <1% signup rate, <30% confirm problem
**Pivot:** Developers struggle with AI agent quality, not infrastructure
**New Solution:** Focus on agent quality tools, not infrastructure

---

### Example 2: Customer Pivot

**Original:** Solo founders are best customers
**Evidence:** <10% conversion rate, <40% activation
**Pivot:** Product teams are better customers
**New Solution:** Focus on product teams, build team collaboration features

---

### Example 3: Solution Pivot

**Original:** Platform approach (hosted service)
**Evidence:** <50% satisfaction, customers want self-hosted
**Pivot:** Self-hosted solution with managed option
**New Solution:** Offer both self-hosted and managed options

---

### Example 4: Revenue Pivot

**Original:** $49-199/month SaaS pricing
**Evidence:** <5% conversion, customers want usage-based
**Pivot:** Usage-based pricing model
**New Solution:** Pay per API call, not monthly subscription

---

### Example 5: Growth Pivot

**Original:** Marketplace flywheel
**Evidence:** <1.0 viral coefficient, marketplace not working
**Pivot:** Sales-driven growth
**New Solution:** Build sales team, focus on enterprise sales

---

### Example 6: Market Pivot

**Original:** Education market beachhead
**Evidence:** <$100K ARR, long sales cycles
**Pivot:** Broader developer market
**New Solution:** Focus on all developers, not just education

---

## Persistence Criteria

### When to Persist (Not Pivot)

**Early Stage Uncertainty:**
- Normal to have low metrics early
- Need time to iterate and improve
- Don't pivot too early

**Temporary Setbacks:**
- One bad experiment doesn't mean pivot
- Need multiple data points
- Look for trends, not single data points

**Competition:**
- Competition is normal
- Focus on differentiation
- Don't pivot just because competitors exist

**Learning Curve:**
- Need time to learn and improve
- Early mistakes are learning opportunities
- Don't pivot before giving current approach a fair chance
