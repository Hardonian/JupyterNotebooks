## Overview

This document analyzes alternatives to Agent Factory and why customers switch from alternatives to Agent Factory. Understanding alternatives helps us position the product and identify switch moments.

---

## Alternative 1: Build Infrastructure from Scratch

### What It Is
Build all infrastructure (auth, billing, deployment, monitoring) from scratch.

### Why Customers Choose This
- **Full Control:** Complete control over infrastructure
- **No Vendor Dependency:** Not dependent on third-party platform
- **Custom Solution:** Can build exactly what they need
- **Learning:** Learn infrastructure skills

### Why They Switch to Agent Factory
- **Time:** Takes months vs. days (10x slower)
- **Cost:** Need to hire engineers ($100K+/year) vs. $49-199/month (100x more expensive)
- **Complexity:** Very complex (many components) vs. simple (one platform)
- **Focus:** Spend time on infrastructure vs. product (wrong focus)

### Switch Moment
**"When time becomes critical"**
- Prototype works, but deployment blocked
- Competitors moving faster
- Need to ship fast
- Realize infrastructure complexity

### Customer Quote (Hypothetical)
"I spent 3 months building infrastructure. Then I found Agent Factory and deployed in a day. I wish I'd found it sooner."

## Alternative 2: Use LangChain/CrewAI + Build Infrastructure

### What It Is
Use existing agent framework (LangChain, CrewAI) but still need to build infrastructure.

### Why Customers Choose This
- **Existing Framework:** Framework already exists, community support
- **Familiar:** Many developers know these frameworks
- **Flexible:** Can customize framework
- **Open Source:** Free, can modify

### Why They Switch to Agent Factory
- **Infrastructure Gap:** Still need to build infrastructure (auth, billing, deployment)
- **Not Production-Ready:** Framework doesn't include production infrastructure
- **Complexity:** Still complex (framework + infrastructure)
- **Time:** Still takes months to deploy

### Switch Moment
**"When they try to deploy and realize infrastructure gap"**
- Framework works, but can't deploy
- Realize infrastructure is missing
- Don't know how to build infrastructure
- Need production-ready solution

### Customer Quote (Hypothetical)
"LangChain is great for prototyping, but when I tried to deploy, I hit the infrastructure wall. Agent Factory solved that."

---

## Alternative 3: Hire Developers to Build Infrastructure

### What It Is
Hire developers (infrastructure engineers) to build infrastructure.

### Why Customers Choose This
- **Expertise:** Developers have expertise
- **Can Build Anything:** Can build custom solution
- **Professional:** Professional development
- **Control:** Can manage team

### Why They Switch to Agent Factory
- **Cost:** Expensive ($100K+/year per engineer) vs. $49-199/month (100x cheaper)
- **Time:** Slow (hiring takes months) vs. immediate (sign up today)
- **Dependency:** Dependent on team vs. self-serve (more control)
- **Complexity:** Still need to manage team vs. platform handles it

### Switch Moment
**"When they realize cost and time constraints"**
- Can't afford to hire engineers
- Hiring takes too long
- Need to move fast
- Realize platform is better value

### Customer Quote (Hypothetical)
"I was about to hire an infrastructure engineer for $150K/year. Then I found Agent Factory for $199/month. No brainer."

## Alternative 4: Use No-Code Platform

### What It Is
Use no-code platform (Zapier, Bubble, etc.) to build AI agents.

### Why Customers Choose This
- **Easy:** No coding required
- **Fast:** Fast to start
- **Visual:** Visual builder
- **Affordable:** Lower cost (sometimes)

### Why They Switch to Agent Factory
- **Limited Flexibility:** Can't customize vs. full control (code-first)
- **Not Developer-Friendly:** Not for developers vs. developer-focused
- **Limited Features:** Limited features vs. comprehensive platform
- **Vendor Lock-In:** Locked into platform vs. open core (more control)

### Switch Moment
**"When they hit limitations, need more control"**
- Hit platform limitations
- Need to customize
- Want code-first approach
- Need more control

### Customer Quote (Hypothetical)
"I started with a no-code platform, but hit limitations. Agent Factory gives me the control I need as a developer."

## Alternative 5: Use Enterprise Platform (AWS, GCP, Azure)

### What It Is
Use enterprise cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure) to build infrastructure.

### Why Customers Choose This
- **Enterprise-Grade:** Enterprise-grade infrastructure
- **Scalable:** Highly scalable
- **Reliable:** Very reliable
- **Comprehensive:** Comprehensive services

### Why They Switch to Agent Factory
- **Complexity:** Very complex (many services) vs. simple (one platform)
- **Cost:** Expensive (pay for many services) vs. affordable ($49-199/month)
- **Time:** Takes months to set up vs. days (much faster)
- **Expertise:** Need expertise vs. simple (no expertise needed)

### Switch Moment
**"When they realize complexity and cost"**
- Realize complexity
- Costs too high
- Takes too long
- Need simpler solution

### Customer Quote (Hypothetical)
"AWS is powerful, but it took me 2 months to set up everything. Agent Factory did it in a day."
