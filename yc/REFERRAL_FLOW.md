## Overview

This document defines the referral flow strategy—how users refer friends and how referrals convert to new users. Referrals drive organic growth and reduce CAC.

---

## Referral Flow Design

### Step 1: Activation Trigger
**When:** User activates (deploys first agent, runs 10+ executions)

**Action:** Show referral prompt

**Message:**
- **Headline:** "🎉 You're activated! Invite friends and get rewards"
- **Body:** "Share Agent Factory with friends. You both get free credits when they sign up."
- **CTA:** "Invite Friends" / "Get Referral Link"

**Timing:** Immediately after activation

**Frequency:** Once after activation

---

### Step 2: Referral Code Generation
**Action:** User clicks "Invite Friends"

**Process:**
- Generate unique referral code for user
- Create referral link (agentfactory.io/signup?ref=CODE)
- Show referral dashboard (track referrals, rewards)

**Features:**
- Unique referral code per user
- Shareable link (email, social, direct)
- Referral tracking dashboard
- Reward tracking

---

### Step 3: Referral Sharing
**Action:** User shares referral link

**Sharing Options:**

---

### Step 4: Friend Signs Up
**Action:** Friend clicks referral link and signs up

**Process:**
- Friend visits referral link

- Both user and friend get rewards

**Rewards:**
- **User (Referrer):** Free credits (e.g., 1 month Pro tier free)
- **Friend (Referee):** Free credits (e.g., 1 month Starter tier free)
- **Both:** Bonus credits when friend activates

---

### Step 5: Friend Activates
**Action:** Friend activates (deploys first agent, runs 10+ executions)

**Process:**
- Friend activates
- Both user and friend get additional rewards
- Track referral conversion
- Update referral dashboard

**Rewards:**
- **User (Referrer):** Additional credits (e.g., 1 more month Pro tier free)
- **Friend (Referee):** Additional credits (e.g., 1 more month Starter tier free)
