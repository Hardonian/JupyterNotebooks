## Initial Wedge: Education Market

**Why Education First:**

1. **Large Underserved Market**
   - 5,000+ institutions in US, 20K+ globally
   - $1.5B+ serviceable addressable market
   - Growing 15% annually

2. **High Barriers to Entry (Our Advantage)**
   - FERPA/COPPA compliance required (we have it)
   - LMS integration required (we have it)
   - Education-specific use cases (we have blueprints)
   - Partnership channel (McGraw Hill)

3. **High Switching Costs**
   - Once integrated with LMS, hard to leave
   - Annual contracts = recurring revenue
   - Network effects (more institutions → more blueprints → more value)

4. **Strategic Partnership**
   - McGraw Hill Education partnership provides distribution
   - Validates our approach
   - Opens doors to institutions

**The Wedge:**
Start with education institutions deploying teaching assistants and learning tools. Use compliance and LMS integration as moat. Expand to broader developer market once established.
