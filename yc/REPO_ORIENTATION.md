## What Is This Product?

**Agent Factory** is a platform that turns AI agent prototypes into production-ready products. It provides the infrastructure, tools, and marketplace needed to build, deploy, and monetize AI agents without building everything from scratch.

**One-Sentence Description:**  
Agent Factory gives developers everything they need to build, deploy, and monetize AI agents—from prototype to production—without the usual infrastructure headaches.

---

## Who Is The User?

**Primary Users:**
1. **Developers** building AI products (solo founders, small teams)
2. **Educational institutions** (universities, colleges) - strategic focus via McGraw Hill partnership
3. **Product teams** at companies building AI features
4. **Researchers & educators** with domain expertise who want to build tools

**User Segments:**
- Solo founders launching SaaS products
- Small teams (2-10 people) building AI features
- Educational institutions deploying teaching assistants
- Enterprise teams automating workflows
- Agencies/consultants building custom solutions

## What Problem Does It Solve?

**The Core Problem:**  
Developers prototype AI agents in Jupyter notebooks. They work beautifully. People love them. Then reality hits: to turn that prototype into something real, you need conversation handling, error recovery, observability, authentication, rate limiting, billing, multi-tenancy, APIs, deployment infrastructure... Suddenly your simple idea needs a team of engineers and months of work.

**Most projects never make it past this point.**

**Agent Factory's Solution:**  
We've built the infrastructure. We've handled the complexity. You focus on what makes your agent unique. We handle the rest.

**Before Agent Factory:**
- Prototype in notebook → stuck there
- Need to build: auth, billing, multi-tenancy, APIs, deployment
- Requires: team of engineers, 3-6 months, $50K-$200K
- Most projects die at this stage

**After Agent Factory:**
- Prototype in notebook → convert to agent in minutes
- Use platform: auth, billing, multi-tenancy, APIs, deployment all included
- Requires: days to weeks, $99-$499/month
- Ship production-ready products fast

## Main Product (YC-Relevant)

**The main YC-relevant product is the Agent Factory Platform itself** - the hosted SaaS platform that enables developers to build and deploy production-ready AI agents.

**Why This Is The Main Product:**
- Revenue-generating (subscription + marketplace)
- Scalable business model
- Clear value proposition
- Addressable market ($5B+ SAM)
- Multiple revenue streams

**Supporting Elements:**
- Open-source core (GPL-3.0) - developer acquisition
- Blueprint marketplace - network effects
- Education partnerships - strategic wedge
- Professional services - high-margin revenue

## Current State

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Complete platform architecture
- ✅ Core primitives (Agent, Tool, Workflow)
- ✅ Blueprint system
- ✅ Notebook converter
- ✅ Telemetry/analytics infrastructure
- ✅ Billing integration (Stripe)
- ✅ Multi-tenancy support
- ✅ API, CLI, SDK
- ✅ Documentation

**What's Missing (from YC perspective):**
- ⚠️ Real user traction/metrics (need actual data)
- ⚠️ Team information (founders, backgrounds)
- ⚠️ Go-to-market execution evidence
- ⚠️ Customer testimonials/case studies
- ⚠️ Revenue/profitability data

**Status:**  
Platform is technically complete and production-ready. Needs traction, team clarity, and business execution evidence for YC readiness.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Complete Platform** - Not just a library, full infrastructure
2. **Education Focus** - FERPA compliant, LMS integration, McGraw Hill partnership
3. **Marketplace** - Blueprint sharing with revenue sharing (70/30)
4. **Production-Ready** - Billing, multi-tenancy, compliance built-in
5. **Developer Experience** - Python-first, great docs, fast iteration
