# Agent Factory: Product Overview

## What Is Agent Factory?

Agent Factory is a **composable platform for building, deploying, and monetizing AI agents**. Think of it as the Rails or Django for AI agents—everything you need to go from prototype to production.

---

## Product Positioning

**For:** Developers, founders, researchers, and teams building AI-powered products

**Who Need:** Production-ready infrastructure without building it from scratch

**That Provides:** Composable agents, tools, workflows, and a complete platform

**Unlike:** Building infrastructure yourself or using limited no-code tools

**Our Advantage:** Production-ready, composable, extensible, and monetization-ready

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. **Ship Faster**
Build production-ready agents in days, not months. We've solved the infrastructure problems so you don't have to.

### 2. **Production-Ready**
Built-in memory, error handling, observability, security, billing, and multi-tenancy. Ready for real users from day one.

### 3. **Composable**
Agents, tools, and workflows are building blocks. Mix and match to build exactly what you need.

### 4. **Monetization-Ready**
Built-in billing, usage tracking, and marketplace support. Turn your agents into products.

### 5. **Extensible**
Add custom tools, integrations, and workflows. Not locked into our way of doing things.
