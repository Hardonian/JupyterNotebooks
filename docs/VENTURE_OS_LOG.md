## Current Status

### Top 3 Risks/Unknowns

1. **Pre-Revenue** - Need first paying customers to prove willingness to pay
2. **Team Documentation** - Founder names/backgrounds not documented (critical for YC)
3. **Security Audit** - No security audit conducted (critical for enterprise/education)

### Key Gaps

**Foundational:**
- ✅ Local setup: READY
- 🟡 Production deploy: READY (needs credentials)
- ✅ Data/schema: READY
- ✅ Monitoring: READY (infrastructure)
- 🟡 Security: BASIC (needs audit)

**YC Readiness:**
- ⚠️ Customer testimonials: MISSING
- ⚠️ Real metrics: MISSING (infrastructure ready)
- ⚠️ Team documentation: MISSING
- ⚠️ Screenshots/demo video: MISSING

**Investor Readiness:**
- ✅ Data room structure: CREATED
- ⚠️ Data room content: PLACEHOLDERS (need real data)
- ✅ Demo assets: CREATED

## Next Actions

**Founder Must Do:**
1. Document team/founders (`yc/TEAM.md`, `yc/FOUNDER_MARKET_FIT.md`)
2. Deploy to production
3. Get 3-5 early users
4. Document real metrics (even if zeros)
5. Create screenshots/demo video

**Technical Team Must Do:**
1. Conduct security audit
2. Increase test coverage to 80%+
3. Deploy monitoring dashboard

**See:** `yc/YC_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` for complete prioritized TODO list

---

## Consistency Check

**Product Name:** Agent Factory ✅ (consistent across docs)

**User Segments:** ✅ Consistent (Solo Founders, Education, Product Teams, Researchers)

**Problem Statement:** ✅ Consistent (90%+ prototypes fail due to infrastructure)

**Metrics:** ⚠️ Need to collect real data (infrastructure ready)

**Cross-References:** ✅ All dataroom docs reference `/yc/` docs appropriately

---

## Notes

- All documents follow non-verbose, list-driven style
- Placeholders clearly marked with [TO BE FILLED]
- No fabricated metrics (all marked as TBD)
- Cross-references maintained across docs
