## Founder Voice & Perspective

**Key Narrative:**
"After 15+ years helping institutions deploy AI-powered learning platforms at McGraw Hill and Pearson Education, I saw the same problem again and again: great AI prototypes stuck in Jupyter notebooks, unable to reach production because developers couldn't build the infrastructure.

I've also built multiple AI-driven systems myself—Hardonia OS, PromptPilot, Daily Intel Suite—and hit the same wall every time: the AI worked, but deploying it required months of infrastructure work.

**Agent Factory exists because I've lived this problem.** We've built the infrastructure so you don't have to."

**Why This Founder:**
- **Education Market Expertise:** 15+ years at McGraw Hill and Pearson
- **AI/Automation Experience:** Built multiple AI-driven systems
- **Technical Execution:** Comprehensive codebase demonstrates capability
- **Sales & Business:** Proven track record (125% YOY growth)
- **Strategic Position:** Current role at McGraw Hill aligns with partnership strategy
