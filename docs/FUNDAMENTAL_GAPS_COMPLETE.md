## Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS COMPLETE**

We've identified all fundamental gaps and created frameworks/documentation for most critical items. The remaining work is primarily:

1. **Legal Review** - Get templates reviewed and published
2. **Implementation** - Execute frameworks and procedures
3. **Tooling Setup** - Set up on-call, monitoring, cost tracking
4. **Developer Experience** - Create remaining docs and guides

**Estimated Remaining Effort:** ~200 hours over 3-6 months

**Recommendation:** Prioritize legal review and security audit execution, then systematically implement remaining gaps.
