## Objection Handling

### "It's Too Expensive"

**Response:**
"I understand cost is a concern. Let's think about ROI:
- How much does it cost to build yourself? ($50K-$200K)
- How long does it take? (3-6 months)
- What's the ongoing cost? (maintenance, infrastructure)

Agent Factory costs $199/month, which is:
- 1/250th the cost of building yourself
- Available immediately
- Includes maintenance and support

Does that change the equation?"

### "We Need Feature X"

**Response:**
"Tell me more about Feature X. How would you use it?
- Is it a must-have or nice-to-have?
- When would you need it?
- What's the workaround?

We can:
- Add it to our roadmap
- Build it custom (Enterprise)
- Find an alternative solution

Let's discuss options."
