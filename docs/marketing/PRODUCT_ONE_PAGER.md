## What is Agent Factory?

**Agent Factory is the platform that turns AI prototypes into production-ready products.**

Build, deploy, and monetize AI agents in days, not months. Stop wrestling with infrastructure. Start building agents that matter.

## The Problem

You've built an AI agent prototype. It works beautifully. People love it. "When can we use this?" they ask.

Then reality hits:
- Conversation handling
- Error recovery
- Observability
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Billing
- Multi-tenancy
- APIs
- Deployment infrastructure

**Most projects never make it past this point.**
