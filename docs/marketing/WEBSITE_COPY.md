### Problem Statement

You've been there. You prototype an AI agent in a Jupyter notebook. It works beautifully. People love it. "When can we use this?" they ask.

Then reality hits.

To turn that prototype into something real, you need conversation handling, error recovery, observability, authentication, rate limiting, billing, multi-tenancy, APIs, deployment infrastructure...

**Most projects never make it past this point.**

---

### Solution Statement

**Ship faster. Build production-ready agents without becoming an infrastructure expert.**

## About Page

### Page Title

**Built by Developers, for Developers**

---

### Our Story

Agent Factory was born from frustration. We were building AI agents and spending months on infrastructure instead of improving our agents. We knew there had to be a better way.

So we built Agent Factory—a platform that handles all the infrastructure so you can focus on what makes your agents unique.

---

### Our Mission

Make AI agents accessible to everyone. Enable developers to build production-ready agents in days, not months.

---

### Our Values

**Developer-First**  
Everything we build prioritizes developer experience.

**Open & Transparent**  
Open source core, transparent pricing, honest communication.

**Production-Ready**  
We don't ship prototypes. We ship production-ready features.

**Community-Driven**  
We listen to our community and build what they need.
