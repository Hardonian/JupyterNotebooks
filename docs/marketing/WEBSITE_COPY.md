### Problem Statement

You've been there. You prototype an AI agent in a Jupyter notebook. It works beautifully. People love it. "When can we use this?" they ask.

Then reality hits.

To turn that prototype into something real, you need conversation handling, error recovery, observability, authentication, rate limiting, billing, multi-tenancy, APIs, deployment infrastructure...

**Most projects never make it past this point.**

---

**Ship faster. Build production-ready agents without becoming an infrastructure expert.**

## About Page

### Our Story

**Agent Factory exists because we've lived the problem.**

After 15+ years helping institutions deploy AI-powered learning platforms at McGraw Hill and Pearson Education, founder Scott Hardie saw the same pattern again and again: great AI prototypes stuck in Jupyter notebooks, unable to reach production because developers couldn't build the infrastructure.

He also built multiple AI-driven systems himself—Hardonia OS (AI-driven Shopify commerce lab), PromptPilot (SaaS framework), Daily Intel Suite (9 agents delivering insights)—and hit the same wall every time: the AI worked, but deploying it required months of infrastructure work.

**Agent Factory is the platform we wish we'd had.** We've built the infrastructure so you don't have to.

### Our Story

Agent Factory was born from frustration. We were building AI agents and spending months on infrastructure instead of improving our agents. We knew there had to be a better way.
