## Agent Factory Launches Platform to Turn AI Prototypes Into Production Products

*New platform enables developers to build, deploy, and monetize AI agents in days instead of months*

**[City, State] — [Date]** — Agent Factory today announced the launch of its comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and monetizing AI agents. The platform addresses the critical gap between AI prototypes and production-ready products, enabling developers to ship AI agents in days instead of months.

### The Problem

Developers building AI agents face a significant challenge: turning working prototypes into production-ready products requires extensive infrastructure work. Most projects never make it past the prototype stage because building production infrastructure—conversation handling, error recovery, observability, authentication, billing, and more—takes months of development time.

### The Solution

Agent Factory provides everything developers need to go from prototype to production:

- **Production-ready infrastructure** with built-in memory, error handling, and observability
- **Composable building blocks** including agents, tools, and workflows
- **Monetization-ready features** including billing, usage tracking, and marketplace support
- **Multiple interfaces** including Python SDK, CLI, and REST API
- **Blueprint marketplace** with pre-built agent configurations

"Agent Factory is like Rails or Django for AI agents," said [Founder Name], [Title] of Agent Factory. "We've solved the infrastructure problems so developers can focus on what makes their agents unique."

### Key Features

**Composable Building Blocks**
Developers can create agents with natural language instructions, add tools and capabilities as needed, and chain agents together into workflows.

**Production Ready, Out of the Box**
The platform includes built-in memory and conversation context, error handling and automatic retries, observability and structured logging, and rate limiting and security.

**Blueprint System**
Developers can install pre-built agent configurations, share their own creations, and build on what others have made.

**Multiple Ways to Use**
The platform offers a Python library for developers, CLI for quick prototyping, REST API for integrations, and SDK for programmatic access.

### Use Cases

Agent Factory supports a wide range of use cases:

- **Customer Support Bots:** Build bots that handle common questions, escalate when needed, and learn from every interaction
- **Research Assistants:** Create agents that help researchers find papers, summarize findings, and organize information
- **Educational Tools:** Build personalized learning assistants that adapt to each student
- **Internal Automation:** Automate repetitive workflows with agents that understand context
- **SaaS Products:** Turn agents into products with billing, multi-tenancy, and scaling handled

### Quick Start

Developers can get started in 30 seconds:

```python
from agent_factory import Agent

agent = Agent(
    id="calculator",
    name="Calculator Agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful calculator assistant.",
)

result = agent.run("What's 15% tip on $87.50?")
print(result.output)
```

### Pricing

Agent Factory offers a free tier with up to 10 agents and basic features, a Pro tier at $29/month with unlimited agents and advanced features, and Enterprise plans with custom limits and dedicated support.

### Availability

Agent Factory is available now at https://agentfactory.io. Documentation, examples, and the blueprint marketplace are available at https://docs.agentfactory.io.
