## Company Information

**Company Name:** Agent Factory

**One-Line Description:**  
Agent Factory gives developers everything they need to build, deploy, and monetize AI agents—from prototype to production—without the usual infrastructure headaches.

**Website:** [TO BE FILLED - e.g., agentfactory.io]

**Demo:** [TO BE FILLED - production URL or demo video]

## Problem

**What are you working on?**  
[See `yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` for full narrative]

Developers prototype AI agents in Jupyter notebooks, but turning those prototypes into production products requires months of infrastructure work: authentication, billing, multi-tenancy, APIs, deployment. Most projects die at this stage. Agent Factory provides all that infrastructure as a platform, so developers can ship production-ready agents in days instead of months.

**What's new about what you're making?**  
[See `yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` - "What's New/Different" section]

1. Complete Platform vs. Library (production-ready infrastructure)
2. Education-First Approach (FERPA compliance, LMS integration, McGraw Hill partnership)
3. Marketplace Flywheel (network effects)
4. Notebook-to-Production Pipeline (unique workflow)
5. Monetization Built-In (billing included)

## Solution

**How does your product work?**  
[See `yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` - "How It Works End-to-End" section]

**Example:** Sarah, a solo founder, builds a customer support bot:
1. Prototypes in Jupyter notebook → Works!
2. Converts notebook to agent config (notebook converter)
3. Deploys to production (one command)
4. Launches SaaS with built-in billing

**Time:** Days instead of months. **Cost:** $99-$499/month instead of $200K+.
