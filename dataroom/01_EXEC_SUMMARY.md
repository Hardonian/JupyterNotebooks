# Executive Summary

**Company:** Agent Factory  
**Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Status:** Beta / Pre-Revenue

---

## One-Sentence Pitch

Agent Factory gives developers everything they need to build, deploy, and monetize AI agents—from prototype to production—without the usual infrastructure headaches.

---

## Problem

90%+ of AI agent prototypes fail to reach production because developers lack infrastructure expertise. Turning a working prototype into a production product requires:
- Authentication, billing, multi-tenancy
- APIs, deployment infrastructure
- 3-6 months and $50K-$200K in development costs

**Most projects die at this stage.**

---

## Solution

Agent Factory is a complete platform that provides:
- **Production-ready runtime** (memory, error handling, observability)
- **Built-in billing and multi-tenancy** (launch SaaS immediately)
- **Blueprint marketplace** (share and monetize agent configurations)
- **Notebook converter** (prototype to production in minutes)
- **Education focus** (FERPA compliance, LMS integration)

**Result:** Developers ship in days instead of months, at $99-$499/month instead of $200K+.

---

## Market

**TAM:** $50B+ (AI automation, developer tools, education tech)  
**SAM:** $5B+ (developers building SaaS, education institutions, enterprise teams)

**Initial Wedge:** Education market (5,000+ institutions, $1.5B+ SAM)
- High barriers to entry (compliance, LMS integration)
