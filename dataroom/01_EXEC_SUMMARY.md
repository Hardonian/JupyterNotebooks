# Executive Summary

**Company:** Agent Factory  
**Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Status:** Beta / Pre-Revenue

---

## One-Sentence Pitch

Agent Factory gives developers everything they need to build, deploy, and monetize AI agents—from prototype to production—without the usual infrastructure headaches.

---

## Problem

90%+ of AI agent prototypes fail to reach production because developers lack infrastructure expertise. Turning a working prototype into a production product requires:
- Authentication, billing, multi-tenancy
- APIs, deployment infrastructure
- 3-6 months and $50K-$200K in development costs

**Most projects die at this stage.**

---

## Solution

Agent Factory is a complete platform that provides:
- **Production-ready runtime** (memory, error handling, observability)
- **Built-in billing and multi-tenancy** (launch SaaS immediately)
- **Blueprint marketplace** (share and monetize agent configurations)
- **Notebook converter** (prototype to production in minutes)
- **Education focus** (FERPA compliance, LMS integration)

**Result:** Developers ship in days instead of months, at $99-$499/month instead of $200K+.

---

## Market

**TAM:** $50B+ (AI automation, developer tools, education tech)  
**SAM:** $5B+ (developers building SaaS, education institutions, enterprise teams)  
**SOM:** [TO BE CALCULATED - See `yc/YC_MARKET_VISION.md`]

**Initial Wedge:** Education market (5,000+ institutions, $1.5B+ SAM)
- High barriers to entry (compliance, LMS integration)
- Strategic partnership (McGraw Hill Education)
- Recurring revenue model

---

## Traction

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Platform built and functional
- ✅ Multiple deployment options (Vercel, Render, Docker, K8s)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ⚠️ Pre-revenue (need first paying customers)
- ⚠️ Early users (need to document)

**Metrics:** [TO BE FILLED - See `yc/METRICS_SNAPSHOT.md`]
- Users: [TBD]
- Agent runs: [TBD]
- Revenue: $0 (pre-revenue)

---

## Team

**Status:** [TO BE FILLED - See `yc/TEAM.md`]

**Inferred from Repository:**
- Strong engineering team (comprehensive codebase, 174+ Python files)
- Product/design expertise (extensive documentation)
- DevOps capabilities (multiple deployment configs)
- Compliance understanding (FERPA, GDPR frameworks)

**Gaps:**
- ⚠️ Founder names/backgrounds not documented
- ⚠️ Team composition not clear

**Action:** Document team in `yc/TEAM.md` and `yc/FOUNDER_MARKET_FIT.md`

## Business Model

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **SaaS Subscriptions:** $49-$499/month (Free, Starter, Pro, Business, Enterprise)
2. **Usage-Based:** Pay-per-request for high-volume users
3. **Marketplace Revenue Share:** 30% of blueprint sales (70% to creators)
4. **Enterprise Contracts:** Custom pricing for large institutions

**Unit Economics:** [TO BE CALCULATED - See `yc/UNIT_ECONOMICS.md`]
- CAC: [TBD]
- LTV: [TBD]
- Payback Period: [TBD]

---

## Competitive Advantage

1. **Complete Platform vs. Library** - Production-ready infrastructure vs. tools
2. **Education-First** - FERPA compliance, LMS integration, McGraw Hill partnership
3. **Marketplace Flywheel** - Network effects (blueprints → users → blueprints)
4. **Notebook-to-Production** - Unique workflow competitors don't offer
5. **Monetization Built-In** - Billing infrastructure included

**Defensibility:** [See `yc/YC_DEFENSIBILITY_NOTES.md`]
- Compliance moat (education)
- Network effects (marketplace)
- Switching costs (LMS integration)

## Funding & Runway

**Status:** [TO BE FILLED - See `yc/FUNDING_STATUS.md`]
- Current runway: [TBD]
- Funding status: [Bootstrapped / Pre-seed / Seed]
- Funding needs: [TBD]

**Use of Funds:**
- [TBD]

---

## Next Steps

1. **This Month:**
   - Get first paying customers
   - Document real metrics
   - Deploy to production

2. **This Quarter:**
   - Build referral system
   - Launch blueprint marketplace
   - Onboard 10+ education institutions

3. **This Year:**
   - Scale to $1M+ ARR
   - Expand beyond education
   - Build marketplace flywheel

---

## Key Risks

1. **Pre-Revenue** - Need to prove willingness to pay
2. **Competition** - LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT (but different positioning)
3. **Market Timing** - AI agent market still emerging
4. **Team** - Need to document founder backgrounds

---

## Ask

**What We're Looking For:**
- [TBD - Seed funding / Strategic partners / Advisors]

**Why Now:**
- AI agent market exploding (GPT-4, Claude, infrastructure maturity)
- Early market window (first-mover advantage)
- Education digital transformation accelerating
