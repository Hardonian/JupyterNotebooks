# Agent Factory

**Build production-ready AI agents in minutes, not months.**

Agent Factory is the platform that turns your AI prototypes into real products. Stop wrestling with infrastructure. Start building agents that matter.

---

## 🎯 One-Sentence Pitch

Agent Factory gives you everything you need to build, deploy, and monetize AI agents—from prototype to production—without the usual headaches.

---

## 💡 Why This Exists

You've been there. You prototype an AI agent in a Jupyter notebook. It works beautifully. People love it. "When can we use this?" they ask.

Then reality hits.

To turn that prototype into something real, you need conversation handling, error recovery, observability, authentication, rate limiting, billing, multi-tenancy, APIs, deployment infrastructure... Suddenly your simple idea needs a team of engineers and months of work.

**Most projects never make it past this point.**

Agent Factory fixes that. We've built the infrastructure. We've handled the complexity. You focus on what makes your agent unique. We handle the rest.

---

## 🚀 Value Proposition

**For Developers:** Ship faster. Build production-ready agents without becoming an infrastructure expert.

**For Founders:** Launch your SaaS faster. We handle billing, multi-tenancy, and scaling so you can focus on users.

**For Researchers & Educators:** Build tools that help people without getting lost in technical details.

**For Teams:** Automate workflows, build internal tools, create customer-facing agents—all on a platform that scales from prototype to production.

## 🚦 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install agent-factory
```

### Your First Agent (30 seconds)

```python
from agent_factory import Agent, function_tool

@function_tool
def calculate(expression: str) -> float:
    """Calculate mathematical expressions."""
    return eval(expression)

agent = Agent(
    id="calculator",
    name="Calculator Agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful calculator assistant.",
    tools=[calculate],
)

result = agent.run("What's 15% tip on $87.50?")
print(result.output)
```

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Create an agent
agent-factory agent create calculator \
  --name "Calculator Agent" \
  --instructions "You help with math"

# Run it
agent-factory agent run calculator --input "Calculate 20% of 100"
```

### Using the API

```bash
# Start the server
uvicorn agent_factory.api.main:app --reload

# Create an agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "calculator",
    "name": "Calculator Agent",
    "instructions": "You help with math"
  }'
```

## 👤 About the Founder

**Scott Hardie** - Founder, CEO & Operator

After 15+ years helping institutions deploy AI-powered learning platforms at McGraw Hill and Pearson Education, I saw the same problem again and again: great AI prototypes stuck in Jupyter notebooks, unable to reach production because developers couldn't build the infrastructure.

I've built multiple AI-driven systems myself—Hardonia OS, PromptPilot, Daily Intel Suite—and hit the same wall every time: the AI worked, but deploying it required months of infrastructure work.

**Agent Factory exists because I've lived this problem.** We've built the infrastructure so you don't have to.
